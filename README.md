# Code repository for TransLOB 

This is the repository for the paper _Transformers for Limit Order Books_ which uses a CNN for feature extraction followed by a Transformer to predict future price movements from limit order book data.

The code is in iPython notebooks, of the form simptrans_vN.ipynb where larger N means later :

* ``translob_v1.ipynb`` uses the FI-2010 environment with CNN + Transformer (run on Colab)
