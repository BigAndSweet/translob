# Code repository for TransLOB 

This is the repository for the paper ``Transformers for limit order books`` which uses a transformer architecture to predict future price movements and embeds this architecture into a reinforcement learning agent for optimal execution.

The code is in iPython notebooks, of the form simptrans_vN.ipynb where larger N means later :

* ``translob_v1.ipynb`` uses the FI-2010 environment with CNN + Transformer (run on Colab)
